# What is MPT?  <a id="what"></a>
Mentorship Program Tracker aims to make tracking the progress of the mentees easier and digital for all educational institutions. We started by making the [design](https://www.figma.com/file/haofGDovUBBTcLC6TTpRqT/mentoring-project-tracking-app?node-id=65%3A91) using an online designing tool called Figma while the frontend of the project is made using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Javascript. All of these combined are used to make a basic functional and responsive website. The website features a sign in and sign up page, the faculty , admin and student dashboards, student profiles, meeting scheduling, details regarding meetings and activity logs. We Later made the Database [Schema](https://drawsql.app/teams/student-599/diagrams/mpt-db-schema) using the tool drawSQL The backend is made using Django, an open-source python web framework used for rapid development, pragmatic, maintainable, clean design, and secure websites.
